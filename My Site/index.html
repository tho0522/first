        <h3>Designing Creations</h3>
        <p>My father made a career change during the recession of 2008 from hardware to software. When I was young I wanted to be just like him and began my journey
          in attempt to be a Web Developer. I quickly became bored of it at the age of 14. Over the course of my life since then, programming has come up in my life numerous times.
          In college I helped develope a word and click base video game. During the COVID-19 Stay at Home Order, I finally had the time and lack of excuse to learn. </p>

        <h3>Cocktail Bartender</h3>
        <p>In early 2017, a family friend asked me if I wanted to work in the bar industry. I had already worked in the restaraunt industry since 2010, had accumulated customers service skills and was currently managing 2 restaraunts.
          I thought to myself "How hard can it be?".I was wrong. I worked Tuesday through Saturday as a cocktail waitress for the #1 Cocktail Bar in Atlanta and worked side by side with the top mixologists in Georgia.
          Eventually, I ventured to other bars, seaking bartending and mixology experience, With time and educations from the best; I fell in love with bartending and mixology.</p>

        <h3>Sales and Marketing</h3>
        <p>I have always had a knack for sales. I was a personal travel agent, firearm sales representative, and vehicle sales.
          When I started as a Sales Associate at Infiniti, I knew nothing about cars; other than what I hear in day to day life. I loved not having any prior knowledge.
          I love a challenge. I not only had to learn and grasp knowledge about our current year vehicles, but every vehicle ever made. Auto Sales was definately a challenge worth taking on.
          I always say "I know what I know and I know what I don't know. Why not try making the ladder category smaller?" </p>
